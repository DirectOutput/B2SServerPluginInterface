Changing and extending the library {#change}
============================================

You are very welcome to download, analyze, change and reuse the source code of this library. However, since changes to the plugin interfaces can lead to problems recognizing and loading a plugins, your changes will very likely <b>not</b> be integrated into the project even if you push them back to GitHub.

If you really think that the libary is missing something important, please contact one of the team members of the project, so your change can be considered for integration.

Please report any issues with this interface library by creating a new issue on the GitHub page for the project: https://github.com/DirectOutput/B2SServerPluginInterface/issues
