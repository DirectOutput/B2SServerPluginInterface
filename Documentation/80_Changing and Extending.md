Changing and extending the library {#change}
============================================

You are very welcome to download, analyze, change and reuse the source code of this library. However, since changes to the plugin interfaces can lead to problems recognicing and loading a plugins, yor changes will very likely <b>not</b> be integrated into the projects even if you push them back to GitHub.

If you really think, that the libary is missing something important, please contact one of the team member of the project.
