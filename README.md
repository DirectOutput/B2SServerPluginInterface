	  B2SServerPluginInterface
	  ========================
      Interface library for the plugin function of the great B2S.Server.

	  The B2S.Server has a plugin interface which allows other libraries to listen to the data flow between Pinmame and the application calling PinMame (e.g. Visual Pinball). 
	  This interface library specifies the methods and properties which have to be supported by the plugins so they are recognized by the B2S.Server.

      Please read the documentation on the interface library at http://directoutput.github.io/B2SServerPluginInterface.
